# Net Coder

The app sample for DotNet Coder. Mainly for begginers like me :D !
Really I'm trying to build this app according to my #dotnetcore apps and trying to follow best practices.

## Dependencies

- [express](https://expressjs.com). Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framewokr that provice a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **swagger**: 'swagger-ui-express' and 'swagger-jsdoc', to build API Rest using Swagger/OppenApi standards.
- [structured-log](https://github.com/structured-log/structured-log). Logging framework for JavaScript, inspired by **Serilog** (for DotNet).
- [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html).
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/). Like Linq for DotNet, makes JavaScript easier working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
- [mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Test framework making asynchronous testing simple and fun.

## TODO:

- 

## Next steps

- Dependency Injection: [awilix](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix), ... ?
- Unit Tests: -> Mocha
- Integration Tests: --> Mocha?
